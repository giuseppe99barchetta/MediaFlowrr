This project aim to automatically organizes downloaded files from a source folder (for example JDownloader download folder), renaming them and moving them into appropriate folders based on movie/TV show information retrieved from the TMDB API. It‚Äôs designed (but not mandatory) to integrate with media server software like Jellyfin or Plex.

## ‚ú® Main Features
‚úÖ **Automatic organization of movies and TV shows** using TMDB metadata <br>
üìÅ **Multi-folder support**: recursively scans the source directory <br>
üß† **Language detection** from file names <br>
üõ†Ô∏è **Smart renaming** with uniform formatting <br>
üïò **Full cron job** support for scheduled scans <br>
üîß **Simple configuration** via environment variables <br>
üê≥ **Available as a Docker container** via GHCR/Docker Hub or Python Script <br>

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: The script requires Python 3.7 or higher.
- **Docker (Optional)**: For containerized deployment.
- **TMDB API Key (Optional)**: You can obtain an API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

### Using Python

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giuseppe99barchetta/MediaFlowrr
   cd MediaFlowrr
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Script**:
   Create a `.env` file with your specific settings:

   - `SOURCE_FOLDER`: The directory where your downloader places the media.
   - `LIBRARY_FOLDER`: The root directory where your media files are stored.
   - `MOVIE_FOLDER`: The subfolder within `LIBRARY_FOLDER` for movies.
   - `TV_FOLDER`: The subfolder within `LIBRARY_FOLDER` for TV shows.
   - `TMDB_API_KEY`: API key retrieved from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
   - `CHUNK_SIZE`: The chunk size used when copying files from source folder to media folder (adjust if needed).
   - `CRON_SCHEDULE`: Cron expression to schedule periodic runs inside the container.
   - `TZ` (optional): Timezone string for scheduling.

## Usage

1. **Populate Download Folder**:
   Ensure that the downloader has completed downloading the files you want to organize and they are present in its download folder.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python entrypoint.py
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   The script will log its progress, including any errors or skipped files. Check the console output for information.

### Using Docker

1. **Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub**:
```bash
   docker pull ciuse99/mediaflowrr:latest
```

2. **Run the container, passing your variables**:
```bash
   docker run -d \
     -e SOURCE_FOLDER=/path/to/downloads \
     -e LIBRARY_FOLDER=/path/to/library \
     -e MOVIE_FOLDER=movies \
     -e TV_FOLDER=tv \
     -e TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
     -e CRON_SCHEDULE=*/30 * * * * \
     -e TZ=Europe/Rome \
     -e CHUNK_SIZE=4096 \
     -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
     -e FILE_NAME_LANGUAGE=en-EN \
     -v /host/downloads:/path/to/downloads:ro \
     -v /host/library:/path/to/library \
     ciuse99/mediaflowrr:latest
```

2. **Or use the docker-compose**:
```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     mediaflowrr:
       image: ciuse99/mediaflowrr:latest
       volumes:
         - /mnt/jdownloader:/media/source # Path to your downloaded media folder
         - /mnt/jellyfin:/media/library # Path to your media library
       environment:
         - MOVIE_FOLDER=movies # Path to your movie folder inside the media library
         - TV_FOLDER=tv # Path to your TV shows folder inside the media library
         - CHUNK_SIZE=4096 # Size of the chunks to process (leave as default unless you have specific needs)
         - TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY # Replace with your actual TMDB API key
         - LOG_LEVEL=INFO # Set the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
         - FILE_NAME_LANGUAGE=en-EN # Language for file names (e.g., en-EN, it-IT)
         - CRON_SCHEDULE=*/30 * * * * # Cron schedule for running the service (every 30 minutes)
         - TZ=Europe/Rome # Set your timezone
       restart: unless-stopped
```
